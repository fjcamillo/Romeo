Romeo, your personal AI payment assistant. Forget about cash, credit card / debit card, or even mobile phone apps. Romeo is the cashless way to go.

Romeo uses new technologies to enhance the payment experience while still getting the job done. With machine learning at its core. The developers of Romeo was able to incorporate machine vision and AI-Chatbot together.

### How does it work?

Romeo will be a new mode of payment for businesses. The person who have signed in to the Romeo could pay any transaction using the app, which is directly tied-in to your bank account. The business teller could just take a photo of the person then 'voila' you have just payed your transaction. No more cash, no more cards, no more mobile phone apps.

### Use cases:

#### Payment for Restaurants
* Restaurant owners could benefit heavily on Machine Vision, recurrent customers could drastically increase their revenue. One thing that drives recurrent customers is the way how employees interact with them. Was the safety security guard polite?, was the waiter happy doing his job, was the chef on time and precise with the extra requirements given by the customer and lastly, was the teller precise with how they get the orders of the customer. It all adds up to a better customer experience with the addition of Romeo. All of this could be enhanced. Making the customer feel better, while hitting that revenue growth for the restaurant
